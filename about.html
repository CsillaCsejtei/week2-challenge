      <header>Hi, I am Csilla Csejtei</header>

        <p>
          With a decorated background in professional sports — including five
          Hungarian Boxing Championship titles, two European Boxing Championship
          bronze medals, and a European Kickboxing Championship bronze — I bring
          focus, resilience, and a strong work ethic to my career in tech. After
          transitioning from quality assurance in the vitamin manufacturing
          industry, I followed my long-standing passion for technology and
          graduated from SheCodes in May 2025 as a Front-End Developer. My
          studies have covered HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, GitHub,
          Netlify, React, Axios, Python, AI, responsive design, and more. I’m
          currently deepening my knowledge of back-end technologies, working
          toward becoming a full-stack developer who builds thoughtful,
          user-focused digital experiences.
